<H1>Gamma Exposure Visualizer</H1>
<p>This project allows users to visualize Gamma Exposure (GEX) data for different strike prices using real-time market data. It helps traders and financial analysts better understand the relationship between options pricing and the underlying assetâ€™s price changes. The tool fetches market data, calculates GEX values, and dynamically updates charts to reflect the data.</p>

<H2>How It Works</H2>
<p>
The program fetches live data from the yfinance API and calculates Gamma Exposure (GEX) using options data for a given ticker symbol. The core calculations are handled through custom classes like GEXCalculator and the visualizations are updated in real-time using Plotly for dynamic chart rendering.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fetch Data: The program retrieves options data (such as spot price, volume, and open interest) for a given ticker symbol.</li>
  <li>Calculate GEX: Using the fetched data, the GEX for each strike price is computed.</li>
  <li>Visualization: The results are plotted and displayed dynamically on a dashboard.</li>
</ul>
